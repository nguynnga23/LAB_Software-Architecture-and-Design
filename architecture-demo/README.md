# Layered Architecture
### **Description**
Layered Architecture divides an application into distinct layers: Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access. This separation ensures maintainability and scalability.

### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/layered/
├── controller/                 # REST Controllers
├── dto/                        # Data Transfer Objects
├── service/                    # Business Logic Layer
├── repository/                 # Data Access Layer
├── entity/                     # JPA Entities
├── exception/                  # Custom Exceptions
```
### **How It Works**
1. The user sends an HTTP request to the Controller.
2. The Controller invokes the Service to process the business logic.
3. The Service interacts with the Repository for database access.
4. Data flows back through the layers: **Repository → Service → Controller → Client**.

# Pipeline Architecture
### **Description**
Pipeline Architecture processes data through sequential or parallel steps (stages) in a pipeline.
### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/pipeline/
├── stages/                     # Processing stages
│   ├── InputStage.java         # Reads input data
│   ├── TransformationStage.java# Transforms data
│   ├── OutputStage.java        # Writes output data
├── PipelineExecutor.java       # Executes the pipeline
```
### **How It Works**
1. Data flows through each stage in the pipeline **(Input → Transformation → Output)**.
2. Stages can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

# Microkernel Architecture
### **Description**
Microkernel Architecture is designed for extensibility through plugins, suitable for modular systems.
### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/microkernel/
├── core/                       # Core system
│   ├── Kernel.java             # Main kernel
│   └── PluginManager.java      # Plugin manager
├── plugins/                    # Plugins for extension
│   ├── AdditionPlugin.java     # Addition plugin
│   ├── SubtractionPlugin.java  # Subtraction plugin
```
### **How It Works**
1. The **Kernel** starts and manages the core system. 
2. The **PluginManager** dynamically loads and executes plugins based on user needs.

# Service-Based Architecture
### **Description**
Service-Based Architecture divides logic into smaller, reusable services for better modularity and scalability.
### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/servicebased/
├── services/                   # Business services
│   ├── OrderService.java       # Order handling service
│   ├── EmailService.java       # Email sending service
├── controller/                 # REST Controllers
│   └── ServiceController.java

```
### **How It Works**
1. The **ServiceController** receives HTTP requests and invokes appropriate services.
2. **Services** are independent and handle specific business logic.

# Event-Driven Architecture
### **Description**
Event-Driven Architecture operates on events with an Event Publisher and Listeners.
### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/eventdriven/
├── events/                     # Event definitions
├── listeners/                  # Event listeners
├── publisher/                  # Event publishers
```
### **How It Works**
1. **EventPublisher** generates and pushes events.
2. **Registered** **Listeners** process the received events asynchronously.

# Space-Based Architecture
### **Description**
Space-Based Architecture improves performance by using in-memory data grids for storage and processing.
### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/spacebased/
├── spaces/                     # In-memory data storage
│   ├── DataSpace.java          # Data storage
│   ├── CacheManager.java       # Cache manager
├── services/                   # Business services

```
### **How It Works**
1. Data is stored in **DataSpace** or **CacheManager**.
2. **Services** access cached data instead of querying the database.

# Orchestration-Driven SOA
### **Description**
This architecture orchestrates multiple services via a centralized **Orchestrator**.
### **Directory Structure**
```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example/orchestration/
├── orchestrator/               # Orchestration logic
├── services/                   # Independent services
```
### **How It Works**
1. The **Orchestrator** executes workflows and coordinates services.
2. Each service performs specific tasks within the workflow.

# Microservices Architecture
### **Description**
Microservices Architecture decomposes an application into small, independently deployable services.
### **Directory Structure**
#### Product Service
```plaintext
product-service/
├── src/main/java/com/example/product/
├── controller/                 # REST Controllers
├── service/                    # Business Logic
├── repository/                 # Data Access Layer
├── entity/                     # JPA Entities
```

#### Order Service
```plaintext
order-service/
├── src/main/java/com/example/order/
├── controller/                 # REST Controllers
├── service/                    # Business Logic
├── repository/                 # Data Access Layer
├── entity/                     # JPA Entities
```
### **How It Works**
1. Each service is deployed independently and communicates via an API Gateway or Message Queue.
2. Microservices are highly modular and scalable.
